Welcome to my REST API for a made up school curriculum! Where you GET the enjoyment of a clean database with the validation features, but you stay PUT becuase the user authentication.

## Application Description and Goals:

This REST API takes care of the under the hood operations of a school curriculum database. Authenicated _Users_ can create, edit, and delete _Courses_ with proper validation in place on the model level to maintain clean data in the database.

To get up and running with this project, run the following commands from the root of the folder that contains this README file.

First, install the project's dependencies using `npm`.

```
npm install

```

Second, seed the SQLite database.

```
npm run seed
```

And lastly, start the application.

```

```

To test the Express server, browse to the URL [http://localhost:5000/](http://localhost:5000/).

The `RESTAPI.postman_collection.json` file is a collection of Postman requests that you can use to test and explore your REST API.
